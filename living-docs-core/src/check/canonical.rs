//! ADR 0019 canonical round-trip check (slice S3): a record whose on-disk
//! frontmatter block does not byte-equal the frontmatter block of its own
//! canonical re-serialization (`crate::record::extract_record` ->
//! `crate::record::to_canonical_markdown`) was hand-written rather than
//! produced by a CLI verb, so it is flagged with `living-docs fmt` named as
//! the remediation. Only the frontmatter block is compared — the body is out
//! of scope (the S2 `normalize_frontmatter_gap` lesson: `extract_record`
//! leaves a leading newline on the body that never needs reconciling for a
//! frontmatter-only comparison). The check verifies canonical form (key
//! order, spacing, quoting), never values: an author-owned value round-trips
//! untouched as long as its formatting was already canonical.
