# Living Docs

**Run a project's engineering decisions as a living log — not a write-once artifact that rots.**

> **This is an experiment and it changes constantly.** Verbs and record formats may
> change between releases without a deprecation window — see ADR 0059 for the latest
> cut. Pin a release tag rather than tracking `main` if you need stability.

Living Docs is an **AI agent skill** for **documentation-as-code** that keeps a
codebase's decision log in sync with its code. It works with **Claude Code**, **Cursor**,
**GitHub Copilot**, **OpenCode**, **Codex**, and **Pi** — any agent that loads
markdown "skills" / instruction files. It is stack-agnostic: it governs *how* decisions
are recorded and maintained (Architecture Decision Records, issues, research notes, an
optional PRD, a constitution, living [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) architecture
views), never *what* technology a project uses.

The mechanical half of that discipline is owned end-to-end by the bundled
**`living-docs` CLI** — one self-contained Rust binary with ten verbs that
**scaffolds records** (`new`), **drives their lifecycle** (`set`, `supersede`),
**rebuilds indexes** (`index`, `fmt`), **validates the invariants** (`check`),
**compiles the in-force view an agent reads** (`read`), and **serves the skill
corpus and the enforcement hooks** (`guide`, `install`, `uninstall`). There is no LLM
inside the tool: the agent writes only the judgment prose; everything mechanical is
deterministic and reproducible.

The whole discipline collapses to one spine:

> **Every piece of knowledge has exactly one home, that home is indexed, and a
> material decision ships with its record.**

Everything else — the constitution, ADRs, PRDs, issues, research notes and
architecture views — hangs off that spine.

## Why this exists

Most documentation rots because there is no contract keeping it honest. Living
Docs adds five governance invariants that an agent (or a human) can re-derive
every action from:

1. **Docs-first.** Author the body in the repo (`docs/…`) *before* publishing
   to any tracker or wiki. The repo file is the source of truth; the external
   copy is a mirror.
2. **One home per fact.** Each concept, decision, or requirement lives in
   exactly one file. Cross-reference instead of copying — duplicated prose is
   drift waiting to happen.
3. **Indexed or it doesn't exist.** Every doc is reachable from an `index.md`.
   No orphan files.
4. **Supersede, never rewrite history.** Decisions are append-only. When
   something changes, mark the old record superseded and write a new one —
   never silently edit the past.
5. **No structural change without its doc.** New module, moved files, schema
   change, new data flow → update the relevant doc *and its diagram* in the
   same change. No "I'll document it later."

These invariants are carried **in YAML frontmatter as a fact contract** and wired
to a deterministic CLI (`living-docs`) that both authors the mechanical parts and
checks them. The pitch is **not** novelty —
arc42 + ADR + C4 + docs-as-code is a well-trodden stack — it is the **explicit,
agent-enforceable packaging** of it. See [Provenance](#provenance--honest-attribution).

## The doc trail

Only what a change earns appears. A routine change is an issue and code; a decision
expensive to reverse earns an ADR; a product spec worth pinning earns a PRD:

![The doc trail: constitution, optional PRD, ADR, issues, code](assets/doc-trail.svg)

| Artifact | The one question it answers |
|---|---|
| **constitution** | What never changes here? Scope, non-negotiables, the root of trace. |
| **PRD** (optional) | Who asked, what is out of scope, what does success look like? |
| **ADR** | What did we choose, what did we reject, and why? A decision expensive to reverse. |
| **issue** | What is the change, and how do we know it is done? Carries any cheap-to-reverse choice inline. |
| **research** | What does external evidence say? Dated, sourced, append-only. |
| **code** | The implementation the records govern. |

**The one rule that decides whether to write a record:** write an ADR when a future
reader would pay to rediscover *why* you chose this over the alternatives. Otherwise put
the choice in the issue. When in doubt, it is an issue.

Each record type declares its sections in the registry (ADR 0064): which ones are
**required**, and which tier each belongs to. `check` fails a live record that lacks a
required section, and `read` discloses by tier, so an agent loads only the depth the
task needs:

![Read levels: index, --contract, --full; required sections per type](assets/read-tiers.svg)

## What's in the box

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`skills/living-docs/`](skills/living-docs/) | The skill: the five invariants, the doc trail, per-doc-type conventions (`rules/`) and starter templates (`templates/`). |
| [`skills/okf-knowledge-format/`](skills/okf-knowledge-format/) | The **format** standard the docs use — Open Knowledge Format (OKF): markdown + YAML frontmatter, required `type`, reserved `index.md`/`log.md`, bundle-relative links. The OKF spec is **vendored verbatim** from Google Cloud Platform. |
| [`skills/research-artifacts/`](skills/research-artifacts/) | The research-note format and source discipline that feeds ADRs (the `docs/research/` half of the trail). |
| [`cli/`](cli/) (authoring verbs) | **Deterministic authoring**: `new` scaffolds a record with CLI-owned numbering, frontmatter and title heading, and every body section as a `{{SLOT: hint}}` the agent replaces with prose. `set` sets the lifecycle fields, `supersede` wires both link directions and writes the retired-record callout, `index` rebuilds every index, `fmt` canonicalizes frontmatter. Architecture is a first-class doc type: `new view "<name>" --kind <context\|container\|component\|flow\|sequence\|state\|data-model\|deployment>` scaffolds one view per concern in `docs/architecture/`, and the generated index sorts them in C4/arc42 zoom order. |
| [`cli/`](cli/) (`living-docs read`) | **The agent-facing read**: active records only, supersede chains collapsed to the head with a one-line lineage, retired records withheld and counted. `--topic <term>` filters, `--contract` prints each record's contract sections (an issue's Scope and Acceptance, an ADR's Context, Decision and Consequences), `--full` prints whole bodies. An agent reads this, never `index.md`. |
| [`cli/`](cli/) (`living-docs check`) | The **deterministic checker** for the mechanical invariants — frontmatter/`type`, indexing + reachability, link resolution, supersede integrity and the retired-record callout, unfilled `{{SLOT}}` placeholders, required sections on live records (each type's schema in the registry), and Mermaid fences (in-process via the pure-Rust [`merman-core`](https://crates.io/crates/merman-core) parser — no Docker, no daemon). A single self-contained binary: native `serde_yaml` frontmatter parsing and native `pulldown-cmark` link extraction — no host tools needed. *A constraint without an instrument is a vibe*; this is the instrument. It runs at commit and in CI. |
| [`cli/`](cli/) (`living-docs guide` / `install` / `uninstall`) | The skill corpus travels **inside the binary** and is served on demand (`guide --list`, `guide adr`); `install hooks` materializes the session-teaching hook and the pre-commit doc-gate into a project, `install skills` places the corpus into a harness's skills directory. |
| [`references/prior-art-landscape.md`](references/prior-art-landscape.md) | The sourced prior-art analysis — every part of Living Docs mapped to its established originator, so every "credit, not invention" claim has a checkable citation. |
| [`examples/linkly/`](examples/linkly/) | A worked, **lint-clean** end-to-end corpus (constitution → PRD → ADR → issue) for a fictional URL shortener — the discipline shown, not just described, and the fixture CI runs `living-docs check` against. |

Living Docs and OKF compose but do not overlap: **Living Docs governs *which* docs
exist and the no-drift discipline; OKF governs *how* a knowledge bundle's markdown
and frontmatter are shaped.**

## Installation

The `living-docs` CLI is a single self-contained Rust binary with **no host-tool
dependencies at all**, and packaging follows it: the binary is the unit of
distribution, and every skill/hook placement is a CLI verb, never a copy step
a shell script owns. Clone once:

```bash
git clone <this repo URL>
cd living-docs-skill
```

Installing Living Docs is three independent steps:

1. **Install the binary.**

   ```bash
   ./install.sh          # downloads the latest release asset (sha256-verified);
                          #   LIVING_DOCS_VERSION pins a tag; falls back to `cargo build --release`
   # or:
   make cli-install       # thin wrapper over `./install.sh`
   ```

   Useful flags: `--dir <path>` (custom destination, default `~/.local/bin`),
   `--project` (install into `./.living-docs/` as `living-docs` or `living-docs.exe`,
   and ignore that runtime in `.gitignore` while leaving `.living-docs/hooks/`
   trackable), `--uninstall`, `--from-source`, `--dry-run`, `--help`.
   An explicit `--dir` stays unmanaged: it does not receive the gitignore block.

2. **Place the skills** for your harness:

   ```bash
   living-docs install skills --harness claude     # ~/.claude/skills (or .claude/skills with --project)
   living-docs install skills --harness opencode    # ~/.config/opencode/skills (or .opencode/skills)
   living-docs install skills --harness codex       # ~/.codex/skills (or .codex/skills)
   living-docs install skills --harness pi          # ~/.pi/agent/skills (or .pi/skills)
   ```

   `--project` installs into the current repo instead of the global user dir;
   `--dir <path>` overrides the destination outright. Then restart the session
   so the tool picks up the skills.

3. **Arm enforcement:**

   ```bash
   living-docs install hooks [--dir <project>] [--docs-dir <bundle>] [--dry-run]
   ```

   Materializes the session-teaching script into `.living-docs/hooks/`. The
   hook scripts resolve the CLI from `PATH`, then `.living-docs/living-docs`
   or `.living-docs/living-docs.exe`, then `target/release/living-docs` or
   `target/release/living-docs.exe`. Wires
   `.claude/settings.json` with the resolved bundle pinned as
   `LIVING_DOCS_BUNDLE=`, and installs the pre-commit doc-gate at
   `.githooks/pre-commit` (pointing `core.hooksPath` at it). Remove everything
   it wrote with the sibling `living-docs uninstall hooks`. There is
   deliberately **no write-time hook** — a pre-write block teaches the agent to
   negotiate with the block, not to use the CLI; a failing `check` in the same
   session does.

### `make` targets

```bash
make check           # full gate: version sync · file-size ratchet · cargo test ·
                     #   living-docs check the example · validate mermaid ·
                     #   hostile parser fixtures · bash -n all scripts · dry-run install.sh
make build           # build the living-docs binary natively -> target/release/living-docs
make cli-install     # install the living-docs binary onto PATH (fetches the latest GitHub release; LIVING_DOCS_VERSION pins a tag)
make test-fixtures   # run the hostile/negative fixtures guarding the parsers
make help            # list every target
```

### Where each tool loads from

| Tool | Mechanism | Default location (global · `--project`) | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | native `SKILL.md` skills | `~/.claude/skills` · `.claude/skills` | `living-docs install hooks` — session teaching + pre-commit doc-gate |
| **OpenCode** | native `SKILL.md` skills (also reads `.claude/skills`) | `~/.config/opencode/skills` · `.opencode/skills` | `living-docs install hooks` — pre-commit doc-gate |
| **Codex** | native `SKILL.md` skills | `~/.codex/skills` · `.codex/skills` | `living-docs install hooks` — pre-commit doc-gate |
| **Pi** | skills dir + `AGENTS.md` pointer | `~/.pi/agent/skills` · `.pi/skills` | `living-docs install hooks` — pre-commit doc-gate |

**Claude Code**, **OpenCode**, and **Codex** share the same model: they
auto-discover folders of `SKILL.md` files from their skills directory, so
`living-docs install skills` just copies the three skills there (OpenCode
additionally reads `.claude/skills`, so a Claude install already covers it).
**Pi** has no native skills directory — after the skills are copied, reference
them once from your `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Living Docs
Follow the documentation discipline in skills/living-docs/SKILL.md,
skills/okf-knowledge-format/SKILL.md, and skills/research-artifacts/SKILL.md.
```

### Cursor and GitHub Copilot

Both tools read a plain markdown instruction rather than a native skills
directory, and a placement verb for two one-file harnesses isn't worth its
maintenance (ADR 0028). Point them at the skill content directly instead of
generating a file: run `living-docs guide --plain` and paste its
output into `.cursor/rules/living-docs.mdc` (with `globs: "docs/**,**/*.md"`)
or `.github/instructions/living-docs.instructions.md` (with
`applyTo: "docs/**,**/*.md"`) — or just point either tool at the installed
`SKILL.md` under your harness's skills directory. Enforcement is the same
`living-docs install hooks` step as every other harness.

### Skill content — served by the CLI, not copied to disk

Native harnesses (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Pi) only get each skill's slim
`SKILL.md` stub (plus `okf-knowledge-format/reference/`, the vendored spec) — the
full per-doc-type conventions (`rules/`) and starter templates (`templates/`)
travel **inside the `living-docs` binary** and are reached with `living-docs guide`,
not by reading files off disk:

```bash
living-docs guide --list                          # every embedded skill and its topics
living-docs guide                                  # the full living-docs/SKILL.md body
living-docs guide adr                              # just the adr topic's rules (+ template)
```

Output is **context-aware** — for `guide` and every other data verb (`check`, `read`,
`index`, `fmt`, `new`, `set`, `supersede`): piped or otherwise non-TTY output defaults
to minified single-line JSON (the machine-friendly shape another agent parses); a real
terminal gets human-readable, colored plain text. `--json` and `--plain` override the
autodetection in either direction and are mutually exclusive; `--color=auto|always|never`
and the `NO_COLOR` environment variable govern color, and `--quiet` silences
informational stderr lines. Exit codes are stable and documented in `--help`: `0`
success, `1` a gate or a verb's own check failed, `2` invalid usage. `living-docs
completions bash|zsh|fish` prints a shell completion script generated straight from
the same command tree `--help` reads, so it never drifts (ADR 0060).

### Any other tool

Copy `skills/living-docs/`, `skills/okf-knowledge-format/`, and
`skills/research-artifacts/` into wherever that tool loads instructions from, or
just read the `SKILL.md` files — they are plain markdown meant to be read by
humans and agents alike.

### Companion skills (Matt Pocock) — referenced, not bundled

Living Docs *composes with* but does **not** bundle or install Matt Pocock's
skills. His `grill-me` (design interview before a load-bearing decision) pairs
directly with Living Docs, and his `to-prd` / `to-issues` are kindred to the
PRD/issues workflow here. Install them **straight from the source** so they
stay canonical and up to date — his repo is MIT-licensed, so cloning and using
it is permitted (keep his `LICENSE` notice if you copy files):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattpocock/skills.git
# his repo ships a `setup-matt-pocock-skills` skill that wires them up
```

See [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](ATTRIBUTION.md) for how Living Docs relates to his work.

## When to invoke

- Standing up documentation for a project (`docs/` structure, the docs index,
  ADR/issue directories).
- Reading the corpus as an agent (what governs X *now*) → `living-docs read`.
- Writing or editing an **ADR**, **PRD**, **constitution**, or **issue** → load the
  matching topic with `living-docs guide <topic>`.
- Recording **research** → the `research-artifacts` skill.
- Drawing or updating an **architecture / data-flow / sequence view**
  (living Mermaid, in-repo text that must match the code).
- A doc grew too large or mixes concerns → **split into a semantic index**.
- Enforcing the **no-drift maintenance rule** after any structural change → `living-docs check`.

---

## Composition with other skills

Living Docs is deliberately small and composes with the rest of your toolchain
rather than absorbing it: design grilling before a load-bearing ADR, a
deep-research step that gathers the evidence `research-artifacts` then formats,
and an implementation-review step that checks code honors the ADRs.

## Provenance — honest attribution

**This work instrumentalizes established practices; it does not invent them.**
"Living documentation" is Cyrille Martraire's named methodology; ADRs are
Michael Nygard's (supersede-don't-delete is the adr-tools convention); the file
format is Google Cloud Platform's OKF, vendored verbatim; the architecture diagrams
are [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) (Knut Sveidqvist & the mermaid-js community).
None of the doc types are invented here. What is original is modest and concrete: the
**composition + the governance invariants** carried in frontmatter as a fact contract
**and enforced by a checker** — the *enforcement*, not the *invention*.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome — the project dogfoods its own rules. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the repo layout, the invariants it holds
itself to, how to refresh the vendored OKF spec, and how to validate a change —
`make check` runs the full gate: version sync, the file-size ratchet, the test suite,
the docs linter, the hostile parser fixtures, `bash -n` on every script, and a dry-run
of `install.sh`.

## FAQ

**What is an "agent skill"?**
A skill is a folder of markdown instructions (a `SKILL.md` plus optional `rules/`
and `templates/`) that an AI coding agent loads and follows. Living Docs is a
skill that teaches the agent how to keep a decision log in sync with code.

**Which tools does Living Docs work with?**
Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex (native `SKILL.md` skills, `living-docs install
skills`), Pi (`AGENTS.md`), and Cursor and GitHub Copilot by pointing their
rule/instruction file at `living-docs guide --plain`. Because the
skill is plain markdown, any agent that reads instruction files can use it.
See [Installation](#installation).

**How is this different from a documentation generator or a wiki?**
Living Docs is not a generator and not a hosting tool. It is a *discipline* — five
no-drift governance invariants plus a doc trail (constitution → PRD → ADR →
issues → code). The agent **follows** the discipline as it works; a deterministic
CLI **authors** the mechanical half (`living-docs new` / `set` / `supersede` /
`index`) and **verifies** it (`living-docs check`) at commit and in CI. Prompt-level
guidance plus a machine check — not one pretending to be the other. Your docs live
in the repo, in Git, next to the code.

**Why is there no search, database or web UI?**
There was, and it was cut (ADR 0059): nothing in the authoring loop used it, and it
was half the code. `living-docs read --topic <term>` and `grep` answer "where
did we decide X?" on a repo-sized corpus. A search front returns as a workspace
member the day a consumer needs cross-project search.

**What is OKF (Open Knowledge Format)?**
A vendor-neutral format from Google Cloud Platform — markdown with YAML
frontmatter, a required `type`, reserved `index.md`/`log.md`, and bundle-relative
links. Living Docs stores every doc as an OKF concept so the corpus stays
portable and agent-parseable. The spec is vendored under
[`skills/okf-knowledge-format/`](skills/okf-knowledge-format/).

**What does the `living-docs check` checker catch — and not catch?**
It is a deterministic checker over a *documented input shape*, not a general markdown/YAML validator, and its three fragile parsers (link extraction, link resolution, frontmatter reading) are guarded by hostile/negative fixtures (`make test-fixtures`). One known limit: the **structural-graph** checks — directory-index membership and index reachability — read only **inline** links in `index.md`, so a file indexed *solely* via a **reference-style** link (`[x][ref]`) is not yet detected there and would be reported as a false-positive orphan. Link *validity* itself is checked natively by **pulldown-cmark**, which parses every link form (inline, titled, angle-bracket, reference-style, and images).

**Is it tied to a specific language or framework?**
No. Living Docs is stack-agnostic — it governs documentation organization and
lifecycle, not your tech stack.

**Did you invent this?**
No, and the repo says so. Living Docs *composes* established practices (Martraire's
living documentation, Nygard's ADRs, Google's OKF). Full, sourced credits in
